## Demo

File [demo/failing-spec.js](demo/failing-spec.js) has two specs, one of which is failing.
The specs also will produce a lot of log messages if running with `DEBUG=failing ...` flag.
By default we do NOT want to see the debug log messages, but we do need these messages to
debug a failing test. Usually if CI fails, we would rerun the failing test locally with
`DEBUG=failing ...`, but why can't CI do this for us automatically? 

* Run all tests with minimal verbosity. Most of the tests (if not all!) pass.
* If any tests failed during the first run, rerun just these failing tests with
  extra environment variables. For example we can turn on verbose logging.

The demo below shows `locha` in action. First round has all the tests with just
a few `console.log` statements. Second round of testing is triggered because
test "failing spec B" fails, and is rerun with `{"DEBUG":"failing"}` additional
environment variable set, which produces a lot more output.

```text
$ npm run demo
> ./bin/locha.js demo/failing-spec.js --env DEBUG:failing

  failing spec
in "failing spec A"
    âœ“ A
in "failing spec B"
    1) B

  1 passing (14ms)
  1 failing

  1) failing spec B:
     Error: B fails
      at Context.<anonymous> (demo/failing-spec.js:22:11)

mocha finished with 1 failure
Failed first time, rerunning 1 test

  failing spec
in "failing spec B"
  failing a lot of +0ms
  failing verbose +1ms
  failing messages +1ms
  failing in debug +0ms
  failing mode in test B +0ms
    1) B

  0 passing (5ms)
  1 failing

  1) failing spec B:
     Error: B fails
      at Context.<anonymous> (demo/failing-spec.js:22:11)
mocha finished with 1 failure
```

The verbose second run makes debugging just the failing tests simple and quick. I picked
environment variables to control verbosity because to me command line switches control
*what to do*, and environment variables control *how to do it*. Extra logging seems a good
"how to do it" kind of thing.

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save-dev locha
```

## Use

Pass additional environment variables using `--env` string, and specs as a list of files.
For example if we want to set `DEBUG=my-module MODE=test ...` during the second run with
just failing tests, the test command would be

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "locha --env 'DEBUG:my-module,MODE:test' test/*-spec.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "locha": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

## Debugging

To see verbose log messages, run with `DEBUG=locha` environment variable

## Examples

* [CoffeeScript](coffee-example) tests

## Mocha options

Mocha supports a [LOT of command line options](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/bin/_mocha#L62).
Locha only supports some of them. Here they are

```
-t, --timeout <ms>
-r, --require <module name>
--compilers <ext1>:<module name1>,<ext2>:<module name2>
--opts <filename>
```
